# Data-Exploration-Orange-Project

1- Merging data for creating a dataset is an important step after collecting your data
Please create a data table, which has merged data from the below two data sets to gather all info:
A- Titanic_1
B- Titanic_2
Please use orange data mining tool or python
Deliverable Options:
I. If you used Orange :: .ows orange file + screen shots of your output (Widgets connection + data
table output)
II. If you used Python :: Jupyter Notebook (+Download as html that has your .head() output as a
sample)
Bonus: From the output data table, get subset data, which doesn’t have NULLs in Age

2- Data collection from web:
Please get the add the XPATH for the web element related to the “Name” of the shown power supply
from the below link to the jupyter notebook “DEPAI - G7 - Selenium Quiz 1” and run the code to get the
price
link: https://www.amazon.com/s?k=electonics&ref=nb_sb_noss

Deliverable: Jupyter notebook (+Download as html), with the XPATH filled in, run cells, and needed
value extracted correctly
Bonus: list all product names in the web page (hint: One way to do it is to check what is the difference in
the XPATH between two elements of two different products, and replace by *, then loop to print the
returned list)
